# Circus : Better than your average social media

#App Statement

#Main Purpose: 
Circus is the most stress-free app for eternal procrastination that may cure your Internet addiction and satisfy your phone craving.

Looking for inspiration? Want to leave your filter bubble? No actual social commitment attached.

#Selling Points: 	
Find inspirations from totally random and non-trending images of the internet. The feed is not curated to your specific needs or data we have collected about you. Circus offers a virtual social media environment to give user content by mindless scrolling through the endless image feed without actually logging on. 

#Use case: 
When you are bored and sick of what’s available on the mainstream social media platforms, you can always go onto Circus for the alternative feed. The content are not curated for you, and none of your data from your interactions are collected or sold to companies. No FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) from looking at your friend’s holiday photos with their bae - all you get is a plethora of random images to look at. Includes simulated interactions as if it is a real social media app - use it anytime to get out of awkward situations!
